# Project Phoenix
Multiplayer rogue-like text adventure game that turns your wallet into a unique adventure. Built with [MUD](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud).

## Background
Games like [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/) have captivated millions of players worldwide since its introduction in the 1970s, relying on three essential elements: **characters**, **campaign settings**, and the **dungeon master** (storyteller). Each player must develop their **character**, with initial skills across various categories, to embark on an adventure within a **campaign setting**, guided by the **dungeon master**. Originally a tabletop RPG, the game typically necessitates physical gatherings for gameplay. The dungeon master manually facilitates the game, and the quality of the experience is largely dependent on their abilities. Randomness in the game arises from two sources: dice rolling to determine the success of certain actions and the dungeon master's judgment on the story's direction. The entire gameplay constitutes a complex system that entails numerous manual and opaque operations. With the advent of new technologies, our aim is to streamline and automate certain components, allowing manpower to focus on optimizing areas that cannot be automated.

## Function Design
This repo contains three major components of the game: [contracts](https://github.com/ProjectPhoenixZuzalu/project_phoenix/tree/main/packages/contracts), [client](https://github.com/ProjectPhoenixZuzalu/project_phoenix/tree/main/packages/client) and [backend](https://github.com/ProjectPhoenixZuzalu/project_phoenix/tree/main/packages/backend). Contracts form the foundation of the game's core mechanics and logic, assuming responsibility for their implementation. Meanwhile, the backend acts as an oracle, continuously monitoring on-chain activities and relaying them to ChatGPT. 
It also facilitates the transmission of ChatGPT's responses and illustrations for key events generated by [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) to the frontend client.

The client serves as the gateway for players to access and engage with the game. It facilitates the connection between a user's wallet and generates an ephemeral key that the user signs for each session. This allows them to participate in gameplay by sending transactions to the blockchain to progress the story without signing for each single transaction but still saving the game state. More importantly, the client renders text and images received from backend servers, enriching the game experience for the players.

More details will be released soon...
