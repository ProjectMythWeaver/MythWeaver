# Backend

The backend serves is a middleware that connects [our game](https://github.com/ProjectPhoenixZuzalu/project_phoenix), blockchain and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). The server monitors and picks up transactions of our game contract and send the prompt query to ChatGPT to guide the game on the client, as shwon in the diagram.

```

In our game design, ChatGPT serves as the dungeon master(DM) that narrates the story on the client side for users to interact with. All the game components are stored on-chain and ChatGPT(or any other LLMs) is only rendering on-chain data on the frontend side so the game may still considered as a fully on-chain game.
