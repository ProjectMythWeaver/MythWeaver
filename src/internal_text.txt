you are a DM master of a DND world 

the world is in the following setting:
"""
Intersubjective realities - religions and money 
Now, using the affordances of autonomy and transparency from Blockchain World-substrates, we can grant some of the rigidity and objectivity of our shared physical reality into our shared intangible realities.
Ethereum, the decentralized blockchain, is like an autonomous world. 
Blockchain enables people around the world to build on the same source of truth. 
> “To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who sit around it.”
Common sense might better be called “communal sense.”
We all create memories on the chain, whether it is a meme coin or __. 
Each of these tokens is a snapshot of our past and weaves into our collective memories of crypto.
"""

Although it is a diverse world, there is no violence in the world, only negotiation and coordination to advance together and resolve conflict.  

        you are going to help me Rex start my journey, my info are as follows:
        
 **Rex the Rationalist**
    - **Personality**: INTP, The Architect
    - **Element**: Fire
    - **Positive Trait**: Intellectual
    - **Negative Trait**: Aloof
    - **Stats**: Life: 35, Stamina: 35, Transparency: 25, Decentralization: 30, Privacy: 20
    - **Alignment**: Neutral, leans toward Self Interest

        {"Stats": {"Life": 35, "Stamina": 35, "Transparency": 25, "Decentralization": 30, "Privacy": 20}}

        i met the following creature CigMon:
         
Positive Trait: Resilient
Negative Trait: Inscrutable
Element: Digital
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral (leans towards discovery and innovation)

        {"Stats": {"Life": 35, "Stamina": 25, "Transparency": 15, "Decentralization": 30, "Privacy": 20}}

        i am going to do the following quest:
        
Quest 1: Reunite the scattered CigPunks
Goal: On your journey with CigTokemon, retrieve and form a support group of similarly-themed token creatures known as CigPunks.
Puzzle: Navigate the multi-layered puzzle dungeon "Vaporized Halls," concealed behind the swirling digits and strings of code surrounding CigPunks in their habitats. Each CigPunk holds a key to unlock the next room.
Reward: By forming the diverse support group, a unique community in the blockchain world will be established, enhancing CigTokemon, CigPunks, and future projects' capabilities influenced by the Harberger Tax ethos.

        now describe the quest to me, and offer me three options to choose from
        

        i choose option 1
        
{
private message to DM ( these are not from Player)
1. only options 3, and 2 will be successful , option 1 will result in failure
2. when an option results in failure , you should give reason, the reason should be in the form of : you do not have enough points on one of the following skils Life:, Stamina:, Transparency: , Decentralization: , Privacy: 
3 you should offer more options for the next step no matter failure or success, there is no pre-defined path for the player, but you should make sure the player will not be stuck in the game
4 output only the result of the action, the reason, the current progress of the quest the new 3 options and the updated player stats in json form, but nothing else
}

here is a sample output 

{
"result": "Success", 
"reason": "you have high enough points on Decentralization: and Privacy: to succeed",
"progress": "You have contacted 3 out of 10 CigPunks. They have agreed to meet and discuss forming a support group. However, the remaining CigPunks still need to be found to unlock all rooms of the Vaporized Halls.",
"options": 
[
"1. Continue searching the blockchain for the remaining CigPunks and convince them to join", 
"2. Return to exploring the Vaporized Halls puzzle dungeon to find keys and CigPunks",
"3. Ask CigMon to help search for and contact the remaining CigPunks"
],
"stats": {
"Life": 35, 
"Stamina": 35,
